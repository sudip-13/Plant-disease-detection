 ## hereâ€™s a brief description of how disease detection works for tomato, potato, and pepper plants using leaf images:

## Tomato:-
 Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been used to detect and classify diseases in tomato plants.For instance, a CNN-based technique was used to detect diseases in tomato crops. Another study used a deep learning-based system utilizing the plant leaves image data

 ## Potato:-

 Similar to tomato plants, potato leaf diseases have also been detected using deep learning techniques345. A study used a CNN model to classify potato leaf diseases .

## Peeper:-

For pepper plants, an enhanced lightweight model based on GoogLeNet architecture was introduced for disease detection.
